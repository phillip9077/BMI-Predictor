# BMI-Predictor
This program allows a user to provide his/her own face and obtain a rough estimate of his/her BMI. I used Tensorflow and Keras to build a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). The mean squared error of my current model is relatively high due to multiple reasons. They are all described in this tutorial here, so if you're interested in recreating/improving my results, read here: https://learn.pixetto.ai/bmi-predictor-with-keras-and-tensorflow/

The dataset I used to train my model was obtained from this paper:
A. Dantcheva, P. Bilinski, F. Bremond, "Show me your face and I will tell you your height, weight and body mass index," Proc. of 24th IAPR International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR), (Beijing, China), August 2018.
