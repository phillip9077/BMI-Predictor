# BMI-Predictor
This program allows a user to provide his/her own face and obtain a rough estimate of his/her BMI. I used Tensorflow and Keras to build a simple convolutional neural network (CNN). The mean squared error of my current model is relatively high due to multiple reasons as described in this tutorial article here: https://learn.pixetto.ai/bmi-predictor-with-keras-and-tensorflow/.

Here is a link to the tutorial I wrote regarding this project: https://learn.pixetto.ai/bmi-predictor-with-keras-and-tensorflow/
